                HelpSpace was created with the premise of being an inclusive and equitable platform to assist students in 
                finding opportunities to help out in their community. 
            </h3>
            <h3 class = "workDes">
                HelpSpace provides information on a variety of volunteering events, and the search page caters to the users 
                individual preferences by highlighting recommendations. Students can filter, favorite, and register for  
                 volunteer opportunities based on their preferences. Since many high-school students have expressed difficulties 
                with transportation to and from volunteering events, HelpSpace provides a “ride sharing” option. 
                 Through mutuals or organized groups students can request to ride share, aka carpool, to their event. 
            </h3>
            <h3 class = "workDes"> 
                To help users feel accomplished for volunteering in their community, we first created a fun user 
                interface that encourages the user by rewarding “paw points” which plays into an engaging leveling system. 
                Users can also view all the services they helped out at in a comprehensive history log, which can be viewed by 
                categories of volunteer events, or total hours.
